# karpathy-consistency-check.sh — Behavioral-foundation mirror oracle
# =============================================================================
# Closes AUD-2026-018: automates the behavioral-core.md <-> karpathy SKILL.md
# consistency comparison that the source-of-truth blockquote requires.
#
# Why a dedicated checker (not sync-audit): behavioral-core.md and the karpathy
# SKILL.md are NOT in scripts/meta/portable-manifest.sh (they are auto-imported
# doctrine, not manifest-tracked portable artifacts), so sync-audit.sh never
# compares them. A PASS from sync-audit is therefore not evidence about this
# pair. This script is the primary oracle for the pair.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/meta/karpathy-consistency-check.sh [ROOT]
#
# Mode:
#   GLOBAL (ROOT contains products/) — workspace origin. Asserts the full
#           distribution matrix: 16 behavioral-core + 16 SKILL.
#   LEAF   (no products/)           — a standalone receiver clone. Asserts the
#           local repo's pair is self-consistent (count-agnostic).
#
# Enumerator policy: find with path predicates ONLY. grep -r / grep -rl / rg
#   --files are forbidden as enumerators — they silently fail to descend into
#   nested receiver repos (observed: products/derived/DAX_ROOT/* under-scanned
#   by grep -rl, off by 4). The wiki raw source
#   (.claude/agent-memory/wiki/raw/sources/behavioral-core.md) is a different
#   doctrine lineage (6-rule) and is structurally excluded by the path
#   predicate (it is not under .claude/rules/), by design.
#
# Canonical body policy: the synchronized region is "## 1." -> EOF (Rules 1-4
#   plus the closing self-test coda). Everything before "## 1." (frontmatter,
#   title, source-of-truth / skill-handle blockquote, attribution, source link)
#   may legitimately differ. A skill-only footer after the coda is NOT allowed
#   (it would make the extractor outputs diverge).
