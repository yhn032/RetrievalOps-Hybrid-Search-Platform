# AGENTS.md — Codex CLI governance

> Codex CLI mirror of [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Codex CLI auto-loads this file on session start, but does not follow `@import` or cross-file references — so the behavioral rules are **not** auto-loaded from disk. Explicitly `Read` the rule files listed in *Behavioral rules to load on session start* (below) at the start of each session. The same rules in Claude form are at [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Behavioral foundation

Karpathy 4-rule: [`.agents/rules/behavioral-core.md`](.agents/rules/behavioral-core.md) (Think Before Coding / Simplicity First / Surgical Changes / Goal-Driven Execution). Load explicitly with the `Read` tool at session start.

Skill mirror: [`.agents/skills/karpathy-guidelines/`](.agents/skills/karpathy-guidelines/) (`SKILL.md` + `EXAMPLES.md`). Source: [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) (MIT).

## Core principle: INTEGRITY

Every claim must be verified by execution before statement. Don't say "tests pass" without running them. Don't say "build succeeds" without building. Don't say "works" without testing.

## Destructive operations (approval required)

Never execute without explicit user approval: `rm -rf`, `mv`/`cp` overwriting existing files, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP`/`DELETE` on databases.

## Automated workflow (mandatory)

The workflow rules are mandatory. Codex command hooks enforce them after the
project is trusted and the exact hook definitions are reviewed in `/hooks`.
Changed hooks are skipped until re-reviewed. Vetted non-interactive automation
may use `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`; otherwise, run the same gates
manually until hook trust is established.

### Session start (SessionStart hook)

- Hook injects: current branch, active WIP tasks, environment info.
- If WIP tasks exist, read the WIP `README.md` and resume work immediately.
- Otherwise wait for user instruction.
- Always check auto memory (`MEMORY.md`) for known issues.

### Change evaluation

- *Meaningful changes* → use the `refine` skill (`.agents/skills/refine/`) — modify → evaluate → keep/discard loop, not optional.
- *Trivial changes* (typo, single config line) → direct edit, no evaluation needed.
- Never self-evaluate. On Codex, run the `evaluator` skill in a fresh
  `codex exec --ephemeral` subprocess; do not evaluate in the parent context.

### Pre-commit gate (PreToolUse hook)

Before any `git commit`:
1. Run verification for affected code (auto-detected by file type).
2. All checks must pass; no `--no-verify`.

### Multi-session tasks

- Tasks likely to span sessions → invoke the `wip-manager` skill at `wip/task-YYYYMMDD-description/README.md`.
- Auto-resumed on next session start.
- Delete the WIP directory when complete.

### Role delegation

Current Codex releases support in-process subagents and project
`.codex/agents/*.toml`. This template still mirrors Claude role bodies as skills
for portable discovery. The refine evaluator intentionally uses a fresh
`codex exec --ephemeral` process because its contract requires an exact
Contract/diff-only evidence channel in interactive and non-interactive runs.

| Skill | When to invoke |
|-------|----------------|
| refine | Meaningful changes requiring iterative refinement |
| evaluator | After changes (1-pass review); within the `refine` loop |
| wip-manager | When a task spans sessions |
| status | Current-repository status, WIP, and environment snapshot |
| verify | Pre-commit verification |
| karpathy-guidelines | Karpathy 4-rule reference handle (direct invocation or via evaluator) |

## Coding rules

1. **Read first** — read existing code before modifying.
2. **Keep it simple** — minimum code for the task.
3. **Follow patterns** — match existing style.
4. **Protect secrets** — never commit credentials or API keys.
5. **Verify** — build and test before claiming success.
6. **Fix root causes** — diagnose across infra/config/deploy/code; no workarounds.
7. **Explicit failure** — every operation must succeed or fail visibly.

## Communication

- **Language**: customize per team. Default leaves the responding language to the user. Override here in derived projects (e.g., `Always respond in Korean`).

## Environment

- **Claude Code**: native binary (`~/.local/bin/claude`, auto-updated).
- **Codex CLI**: npm global (`~/.npm-global/bin/codex`).
- **Node.js**: Node 22 LTS installed for Codex CLI. Additional version installed if `PROJECT_NODE_VERSION` is set.
- **Persistent volumes**: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `/commandhistory`.
- **9p mount**: `core.filemode=false` (auto-applied by `postStartCommand`).

## Codex-specific paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.codex/config.toml` | Sandbox/approval policy |
| `.codex/hooks.json` | Event hook registrations |
| `.codex/hooks/` | 4 hook scripts (session-start, pre-commit-gate, pre-push-gate, refinement-gate) |
| `.codex/state/` | Runtime markers (gitignored) |
| `.agents/rules/` | Behavioral-rule mirror of `.claude/rules/` |
| `.agents/skills/` | Skill mirror of `.claude/skills/` plus Codex-side conversions of `.claude/agents/*` |

## Vendor constraints

| Constraint | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| Claude and Codex tool matcher names differ | Codex accepts `Bash`, `apply_patch`, `Edit`, and `Write`; current commit/push gates inspect `Bash` commands |
| Evaluator must not inherit parent intent | Use fresh `codex exec --ephemeral` subprocesses with a minimal evidence prompt |
| `frontmatter.tools` / `model` / `color` ignored | Body is preserved; vendor ignores extras |
| No `@import` in AGENTS.md | This file must be self-contained; cross-file refs require explicit `Read` |

## Mirror sync

`.claude/` is the ground truth. After editing it:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-agents-mirror.sh         # regenerate .agents/
bash scripts/sync-agents-mirror.sh --dry   # diff only
```

Do not edit `.agents/` by hand.

## Behavioral rules to load on session start

Codex CLI does not auto-follow file references, so explicitly `Read` **all** of
these at session start (the Claude side auto-imports them via `@import` in
CLAUDE.md):

- [.agents/rules/behavioral-core.md](.agents/rules/behavioral-core.md) — Karpathy 4-rule (Think / Simplicity / Surgical / Goal).
- [.agents/rules/audit-discipline.md](.agents/rules/audit-discipline.md) — negative-space declaration, two-axis counter-tests, external cross-check.
- [.agents/rules/commit-discipline.md](.agents/rules/commit-discipline.md) — one concern per commit; `Coupling:` line for bundles.
- [.agents/rules/destructive-ops-discipline.md](.agents/rules/destructive-ops-discipline.md) — surface narrower alternatives before any destructive op.
- [.agents/rules/anchor-discipline.md](.agents/rules/anchor-discipline.md) — preserve the user's verbatim thesis across multi-stage work.
- [.agents/rules/devcontainer-patterns.md](.agents/rules/devcontainer-patterns.md) — DevContainer DinD avoidance and volume-mount path translation.

## Domain context

- [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) — domain context (services, infrastructure)
- [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) — commands, environment variables, troubleshooting
